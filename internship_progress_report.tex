\section{Background of Work in the Company}

As a member of the Machine Learning Research internship team at SAUGO 360, my primary responsibility involves developing an advanced chatbot system that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to create an intelligent document query interface for the company's internal operations. This project represents a significant step toward enhancing the company's information retrieval capabilities while maintaining the highest standards of data confidentiality and security.

The chatbot system I developed serves as a sophisticated interface between users and the company's document database, enabling employees to retrieve specific information from confidential documents through natural language queries. The system provides rapid and accurate responses to document-related inquiries.

The core functionality of the chatbot revolves around processing various document formats including PDFs, text files, CSV data, and JSON documents. When users upload documents to the system, the chatbot employs advanced natural language processing techniques to understand the content, create meaningful representations of the information, and establish connections between different pieces of data. This preprocessing enables the system to provide contextually relevant responses when users pose questions about the uploaded materials.

The technical architecture of the chatbot incorporates state-of-the-art machine learning models and frameworks that enable sophisticated understanding of both document content and user queries. The system processes user questions through multiple layers of analysis, including intent recognition, context understanding, and relevance scoring, to ensure that responses are not only accurate but also directly related to the specific documents in the company's database.

My role in this project encompasses the entire development lifecycle, from initial research and design through implementation, testing, and optimization. This comprehensive involvement has provided valuable insights into the practical challenges of deploying machine learning solutions in enterprise environments, particularly regarding the balance between functionality, security, and user experience.

The project aligns perfectly with SAUGO 360's broader mission of bringing automation and intelligent solutions to complex technological challenges. By developing this internal chatbot system, the company enhances its operational efficiency while demonstrating the practical application of AI technologies in real-world business scenarios.

\section{Work Completed and Contributions}

\subsection{API Research and Integration}

The initial phase of my internship involved comprehensive research into various Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that could enhance the chatbot's capabilities. This research focused on identifying robust, scalable, and secure API solutions that would support the system's document processing and natural language understanding requirements. The API research laid the foundation for the technical architecture decisions that followed throughout the project development.

\subsection{RAG Technique Comparative Analysis}

A critical component of my work involved conducting an extensive investigation into four distinct Retrieval-Augmented Generation techniques to determine the most suitable approach for the company's chatbot system. The four techniques analyzed were:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Adaptive RAG
    \item Corrective RAG (CRAG)
    \item Document Augmentation
    \item Explainable Retrieval
\end{itemize}

To ensure a fair and comprehensive evaluation, I developed an experimental chatbot system that implemented each RAG technique independently. This approach allowed users to select specific techniques for comparison purposes. The evaluation methodology involved uploading three different document types and formulating 35 identical questions for each document, resulting in a total of 105 queries across all techniques.

The evaluation framework assessed multiple performance metrics including relevance, faithfulness, completeness, semantic similarity, response time, response length, and user ratings. To ensure consistent evaluation conditions, specific parameters were configured across all techniques:

\textbf{Chunk Configuration:} Each document was divided into chunks of 500 tokens with an overlap of 50 tokens between consecutive chunks. This chunk size was selected to balance context preservation and processing efficiency. The 500-token limit ensures that each chunk contains sufficient context for meaningful retrieval while remaining within the optimal input length for the language models. The 50-token overlap prevents important information from being split across chunk boundaries, maintaining semantic coherence.

\textbf{Retrieval Parameters:} For each query, the system retrieved the top 5 most relevant chunks based on semantic similarity scores. This number was chosen after testing various values (3, 5, 7, and 10 chunks) and finding that 5 chunks provided the optimal balance between comprehensive coverage and response generation speed. Retrieving fewer chunks sometimes missed important context, while more chunks introduced noise and increased processing time.

\textbf{Token Management:} The maximum context window was set to 4000 tokens, including both retrieved chunks and the query. This limit ensures compatibility with the language model's context limitations while providing sufficient space for comprehensive responses. Response length was capped at 800 tokens to maintain readability while allowing for detailed explanations.

The results, presented in Table \ref{tab:rag_comparison}, clearly demonstrate the superior performance of the Corrective RAG (CRAG) technique.

\textbf{Technique} & \textbf{Queries} & \textbf{Relevance} & \textbf{Faithfulness} & \textbf{Completeness} & \textbf{Semantic Sim.} & \textbf{Time (s)} & \textbf{Length} & \textbf{Rating} \\
\midrule
Adaptive RAG & 35 & 0.457 & 0.562 & 0.552 & 0.621 & 18.578 & 302.143 & 0 \\
CRAG & 35 & 0.446 & \textbf{0.889} & 0.628 & \textbf{0.712} & \textbf{6.998} & 358.943 & 0 \\
Doc. Augmentation & 35 & 0.353 & 0.391 & 0.570 & 0.692 & \textbf{1.829} & 306 & 0 \\
Explainable Retrieval & 35 & 0.322 & 0.254 & \textbf{0.816} & 0.718 & 13.453 & \textbf{1445.286} & 0 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The analysis reveals that CRAG achieved the highest faithfulness score (0.889), indicating superior accuracy in maintaining factual consistency with source documents. Additionally, CRAG demonstrated the best semantic similarity score (0.712), suggesting better alignment between user queries and generated responses. The technique also showed excellent performance in response time (6.998 seconds), making it highly suitable for real-time applications.

Based on these comprehensive evaluation results, I selected CRAG as the primary RAG technique for the final chatbot implementation, ensuring optimal performance across the most critical metrics for enterprise applications.

\subsection{Comprehensive Chatbot Implementation}

Following the technique selection, I proceeded with the complete implementation of the CRAG-based chatbot system. The development process involved several key phases and technological decisions that shaped the final product.
